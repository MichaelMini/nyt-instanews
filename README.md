# New York Time - Instanews - ajax/json API

Second Project of RED Academy - Full-Time Web Developer Professional

## Project Description - http://michaelmini.github.io/nyt-instanews-jQuery-json-gulp/index.html

To build a website that displays images and article links from the New York Times News. The articles are using the ajax method to dynamically get the NYT Top Stories from the Json API, based on a user's chosen selection of the news catagories.

In order to achive the above, I used the Ajax Get Method to get and .splice() only the first 12 (articles) Json data. Then to use a jQuery function to append() for(each) loop of the array[] into the html5 format onto the page.

The Flexbox and media query allow the website to be responsive to different layout and style depending on the screen size of the user's device. 

## The Tools:

01. @font-face
02. Ajax, Json APIs
03. CSS and JQuery animations
04. Eslint and jshint (sublime text 3)
05. Flexbox
06. Git
07. Gulp
08. HTML/CSS
09. Javascript, JQuery
10. Node.js
11. Responsive Web Design
12. SASS

## Summary 

I have to say that learning new tools such as Gulp watch browser sync and SASS does make the Ajax challenge feel a little bit easier. I was amazed by the endless possiblities how jquery append() array or any object into html format.
