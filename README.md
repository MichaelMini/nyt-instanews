# New York Time - Instanews

Second Project of RED Academy - Full-Time Web Developer Professional

## Project Description - http://michaelmini.github.io/nyt-instanews-jQuery-json-gulp/index.html

To build a website that displays images and article links from the New York Times News. The articles are using the ajax method to dynamically get the NYT Top Stories from the Json API, based on a user's chosen selection of the news catagories.

In order to achive the above, I used the Ajax Get Method to get and .splice() only the first 12 (articles) Json data. Then to use a jQuery function to append() for(each) loop of the array[] into the html5 format onto the page.

The Flexbox and media query allow the website to be responsive to different layout and style depending on the screen size of the user's device. 

## The Tools

* @font-face
* Ajax, Json APIs
* CSS and JQuery animations
* Eslint and jshint (sublime text 3)
* Flexbox
* Git
* Gulp
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript, JQuery
* Node.js
* Responsive Web Design
* SASS

## Summary 

I have to say that learning new tools such as Gulp watch browser sync and SASS does make the Ajax challenge feel a little bit easier. I was amazed by the endless possiblities how jquery append() array or any object into html format.
